# Week-8---DevOps-Journey-Ansible-for-Configuration-Management
This repository contains my hands-on work and learning materials from Week 8 of my DevOps journey. During this week, I focused on **Ansible**, the popular open-source automation tool used for **configuration management**, **application deployment**, and **server provisioning**.

## ✅ What I Learned
- Introduction to Ansible architecture
- Writing and using **Inventory Files**
- Creating **Playbooks** for automation
- Using **Ansible Galaxy** for roles and modules
- Performing tasks like:
  - Server updates
  - Installing packages
  - Restarting services
  - Configuring multiple machines remotely

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Ansible
- Ubuntu Linux (VM & EC2 Instances)
- YAML
- SSH

## 📁 Contents
- `inventory/`: Sample static and dynamic inventory files
- `playbooks/`: Reusable YAML playbooks
- `roles/`: Example roles using Ansible Galaxy
- `scripts/`: Bash scripts used for testing and setup

## 🚀 Next Step
In Week 9, I will begin learning **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning.
